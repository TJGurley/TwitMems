# TwitMems
Simple Twitter application that retrieves old tweets from the current date. For example, running the program on September 1st will give you all your tweets from the past years that were on the date September 1st YYYY.

Note: The Twitter API only allows the previous 3200 tweets from an account to be recovered. The application's GUI can not print emojis (either just print to console or change GUI library to fix).
